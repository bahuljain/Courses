# Probability 

##Probability Models
- linear regression using Gaussian
- logistic regression using Bernoulli's Model
- Likelihood in Probability Models
  - Linear Regression: least squares
  - Logistic Regression: logistic loss

##Generative Models
- Can be used to to synthesize or re-generate data similar to training data.
- eg. Gaussian
- Regression models and classification boundaries not generative.

## Properties of PDFs
- Marginalization
- Conditioning
- Bayes Rule: posterior, likelihood, prior, evidence
- Expectation
  - Properties
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Covariance
  - Conditional Expectation
  - Sample Mean, Var and Cov
- Independence
- Conditional Independence
- IID

##Uses of PDF
- Classification
- Regression
- Anomaly Detection

##Bernoulli Probability Models
- Maximum Likelihood

##Naive Bayes: Text Classification
- Likelihood
- Maximum Likelihood
- Making Predictions
